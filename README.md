To improve my understanding of neural network,I make this——**BabyNN**
Of course,it couldn't be used in actual production.

I reference the [keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras)'s code structure and try to imitate it.  
As for the theoretical basis,I mainly reference two parts information,one is a book called `Make Your Own Neural Network`.(Click [here](https://book.douban.com/subject/30192800/) to learn more),and the other is a project on [github](https://github.com/yizt/numpy_neuron_network).Thanks all of these

To do:  
- achieve convolution layer and pooling layer

Two test file named "test.py" and "mnist.py" is avavailable.  
To download the dataset used in "mnist.py",click [here](http://deeplearning.net/data/mnist/mnist.pkl.gz) please.
